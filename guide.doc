MANALI: Be it hoteliers, restaurant owners, shopkeepers, travel agents or small-scale service providers, the entire tourism fraternity in Himachal Pradesh is upset with the state government for its apathetic attitude towards improving tourism infrastructure.

"Tourism infrastructure in Himachal is the same as it was 20 years back. There is an increase in number of tourists but the amenities are almost same as they used to be years back," rue tourism entrepreneurs in the state. Disgruntled residents who are linked to tourism industry say neither are they able to satisfy the tourists with available infrastructure nor can they encash the natural advantage the state has in tourism in a proper way.
